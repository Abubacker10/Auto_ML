# Auto_ML
Auto_ML , GitHub Repository may ease the flow of machine learning algorithms without any coding ,by with the help of streamlit GUI and Pycaret (python's automate ML modelling package), and one more package ydata-profiling is used for exploratory data analysis

# Idea
HERE , the Auto_ml can perform supervised machine learning algorithms i.e regression and classification by leveraging one of the python's best ml package Pycaret, 
it just automate process of data preprocessing and choosing the best ml algorithm which suit at its peak for the data in terms of better accuracy.
The Exploratory Data Analysis for training data can be done inbuiltly by one more valuable ydata-profiling package , kindly don;t search for pandas_profiling as it was the replacement for it (moved on to it).
ydata-profiling did just make awesome profile report on our data as it includes variablity, correlation,histogram and varios tests ...
by the help of streamlit's streamit_pandas_profiling further we can display the profile report over the application
and atlast we can download the trained best model by clickinn download

# Requirements
Supported on 64-bit systems with:
Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
Ubuntu 16.04 or later
Windows 7 or later

# IMPORTANT PACKAGES 
# PyCaret 3.0
An open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python
PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.
Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more.

Install via PyPi:
You can install PyCaret with Python's pip package manager:
command : pip install pycaret

# Ydata-profiling
ydata-profiling is a valuable tool for data scientists and analysts because it streamlines EDA, provides comprehensive insights, enhances data quality, and promotes data science best practices.
this feature is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis (EDA) as it automatically calculated detailed statistics, visualizations, and insights for each variable in the dataset. It offers information such as data type, missing values, unique values, basic descriptive statistics , histogram plots, and distribution plots. This allows data analysts and scientists to quickly understand the characteristics of each variable, identify potential data quality issues, and gain initial insights into the data's distribution and variability.

Installation:
You can install using the pip package manager by running:
pip install -U ydata-profiling

# streamlit_pandas_profiling
streamlit_pandas_profiling is a tool by which we can visualize the EDA profile report from pandas_profiling into the streamlit web application
you can install it by running the command:
pip install streamlit-pandas-profiling
